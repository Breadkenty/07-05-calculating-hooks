# Assignment Overview:

Practice is key to gaining the mileage needed to conquer programming. A very common practice problem is to recreate a working calculator. A basic calculator is a good exercise in using state, effects, and components to create a powerful and robust UI.

## Objectives

- Practice using _functional components with hooks_
- Practice implementing a UI wire-frame

## Requirements

Create a simple calculator that allows the user to add, multiply, subtract, and divide two numbers. Here is a sample UI:

## Notes

- Take this in small steps just like we did in class. Start with the HTML, then CSS, then with basic functionality.

### Explorer Mode

- [x] Implement something similar to the example UI using HTML and CSS inside a React app
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add two numbers
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add subtract numbers
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add multiple numbers
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add divide numbers
- [x] The clear button should reset the current calculation

### Adventure Mode

- [x] Show the user their history in a list
- [x] Be able to chain together results. For example, the user should be able to input `2 + 3 - 4 + 5` and get the correct answer
- [x] Let the user use their keyboard in addition to the mouse

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Using your systems calculator app as inspiration, implement as many features as you can, including, but not limited to scientific mode, exponents, and the order of operations.
